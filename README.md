LOBSTERDEATH 

There are no great ways for creatives to find other creatives to work with. 

We built LOBSTERDEATH (project name was chosen for us!), using a MEAN stack. We write to the MongoDB after the questionnaire is filled out then read from it to populate the profile page. 

The typical options are for creatives looking to band together are:

* Take a class and hope you connect with at least one classmate. This is especially annoying if you've already taken a lot of classes, and a really expensive gamble.
* Craigslist. There aren't a lot of ads â€“ mostly the same people advertising again and again.
* Meetup. First, the meetups are infrequently scheduled, and few people actually show up. If one is popular, the admin will charge a fee for coming. Also, big groups like this are possibly the worst way to actually workshop.
* Someone gives you their friend's email address and says to look them up. This is probably weird and annoying. How do you know what kind of work the friend does? How do you know if they're looking for collaborators?

LOBSTERDEATH is a platform for creatives to find collaborators. It will ask you a bunch of questions to quantify your compatibility with others based on your tastes, experience, and working style. It should recommend matches.

It will be a safe space to reach out to others without feeling weird or intrusive. It should give you a sense of who you're meeting before you meet them. It will allow you to present work samples in an attractive layout.

Improvisers to start, then writers, then musicians.
